# VSCode Developer Setup

To get started with development in Visual Studio Code, open the workspace file named `nextjs-app-router-boilerplate.code-workspace`.

We recommend installing the following extensions for a better development experience:

- [Auto Import](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=steoates.autoimport)
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
- [Import Cost](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [Tabnine AI Autocomplete](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode)
- [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
- [Console Ninja](https://console-ninja.com/)

For Console Ninja, add the following settings to your `settings.json` file in VSCode:

```json
{
  "console-ninja.toolsToEnableSupportAutomaticallyFor": {
    "live-server-extension": true,
    "live-preview-extension": true
  },
  "console-ninja.allowedHosts": ["localhost:3000", "localhost"]
}
```

## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the project structure:

```plaintext

## Development Rules

### File Naming

- Use camel case for file names.

### Creating New Pages

To create a new page, follow this structure:

```
📁 nextjs-app-router-boilerplate
    📁 app
        💾 page.tsx
        💾 globals.css
        💾 _error.tsx 
        💾 index.tsx
        💾 about.tsx
        📁 <= place new page files here
```

### I18n with next-intl

For internationalization (i18n), we use the `next-intl` package. It provides comprehensive support for localization in Next.js applications.

### Tailwind CSS

We use Tailwind CSS for styling. Here are some useful features:

- [Responsive design](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design): Use breakpoint prefixes such as `mobile`, `tablet`, and `desktop` to apply styles based on different screen sizes.
- [Arbitrary values](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles): Customize your classes with arbitrary values.
- [Changing opacity](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/ring-color#changing-the-opacity): Adjust the opacity of elements.

### SEO

We recommend using the Next.js [generate-metadata](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata).
