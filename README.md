# VSCode Developer Setup

To get started with development in Visual Studio Code, open the workspace file named `nextjs-app-router-boilerplate.code-workspace`.

We recommend installing the following extensions for a better development experience:

- [Auto Import](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=steoates.autoimport)
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
- [Import Cost](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [Tabnine AI Autocomplete](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode)
- [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
- [Console Ninja](https://console-ninja.com/)

For Console Ninja, add the following settings to your `settings.json` file in VSCode:

```json
{
  "console-ninja.toolsToEnableSupportAutomaticallyFor": {
    "live-server-extension": true,
    "live-preview-extension": true
  },
  "console-ninja.allowedHosts": ["localhost:3000", "localhost"]
}
```

## Project Structure

## Development Rules

### File Naming

- Use camel case for file names.

### Creating New Pages

To create a new page, follow this structure:

```
üìÅ nextjs-app-router-boilerplate
    üìÅ app
        üíæ page.tsx
        üíæ globals.css
        üíæ _error.tsx 
        üíæ index.tsx
        üíæ about.tsx
        üìÅ <= place new page files here
```

### Images

**Note: Avoid using next/image as it consumes server CPU usage. If necessary, set up an image loader like img proxy.**

**Note: Avoid excessive DOM size.**

## I18n with next-intl

For internationalization (i18n), we use the `next-intl` package. It provides comprehensive support for localization in Next.js applications.

### Tailwind CSS

We use Tailwind CSS for styling. Here are some useful features:

- [Responsive design](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design): Use breakpoint prefixes such as `mobile`, `tablet`, and `desktop` to apply styles based on different screen sizes.
- [Arbitrary values](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles): Customize your classes with arbitrary values.
- [Changing opacity](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/ring-color#changing-the-opacity): Adjust the opacity of elements.

### React Query

A powerful library for managing remote data fetching and synchronization of data between components. It provides a concise and declarative API to handle data fetching, caching, and background updates. This makes working with APIs and handling data in your Next.js application a lot more efficient and straightforward.

### Valtio 

For state management, they have included Valtio, a lightweight and minimalist state management library for React. With Valtio, managing and sharing state throughout your application becomes a breeze. It simplifies complex state management and reduces boilerplate code.

### SEO

We recommend using the Next.js [generate-metadata](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata).

### Utility Functions

We use Lodash for utility functions. Feel free to use any of its functions in your code.

### Utility Hooks

Take advantage of the `react-use` library, which provides various useful hooks for React development.

### Testing
In this project, we utilize [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for automated testing. Playwright is a powerful open-source library that allows us to automate browser actions and perform end-to-end testing across different browsers.

### Multiple Servers

If you need to deploy the application on multiple servers, refer to this [guide](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-deploy-next-js-on-multiple-servers-3b493d4ce0e9) for detailed instructions.
